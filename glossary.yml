SVM: |
  Support Vector Machine: a data classification algorithm
support vector: |
  Samples on the margin of the separating hyperplane of an SVM.
CUDA: |
  Compute Unified Device Architecture: A GPGPU platform and library.
GPU: |
  Graphics Processing Unit: A hardware accelarator designed for use in image processing.
GPGPU: |
  General Purpose GPU computing: The use of GPUs for accelarion of tasks other than image processing.
QP: |
  Quadratic Programming: A family of techniques for solving optimization problems involving quadratic functions.
SMO: |
  Sequential Minimization Optimization: An SVM algorithm based on coordinate descent instead of reliying upon standard QP techniques.
PSMO: |
  Parallel SMO: A variant of SMO meant for use in parallel computing environments.
Classifier: |
  An algorithm that assigns class labels to data.
OVA: |
  One Versus All: A technique for using binary classifiers for multiclass classification, by training binary classifiers to separate samples into a specific class or one of the rest.
OVR: |
  One Versus Rest: see OVA.
OVO: |
  One Versus One:  A technique for using binary classifiers for multiclass classification, by training binary classifiers to separate samples into one of two classes and picking the class most picked.
